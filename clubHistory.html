          <h2>History of The Saints</h2>
          <p> Cleveland has a rich history of Gaelic sports and in 1948 the St. Pat’s Club was established. St. Pat’s would go on to win several national football championships at senior level in 1962, 1964-1966, and 1968. Years later in 1980, St. Jarlath’s formed to become a perpetual favorite within the Midwest and collect national titles at the junior level in 2005 and 2006. After the 2015 national title by St. Pat’s at the junior level, the two Cleveland clubs rejoined.</p>
